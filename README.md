Team &amp; Contact Introduction &amp; Problem Statement University students possess a diverse range of valuable skills but lack efficient, structured, and secure channels to monetize them or build recognized career portfolios. Traditional freelance platforms are overcrowded, while informal groups (e.g., WhatsApp/Telegram) lack structure and trust. This results in lost opportunities, unmonetized skills, and unverified experiences for students. Solution Overview &amp; Core Features Core Solution: UniKart is a closed, university-only platform for offering freelance services, selling products (digital/physical), and posting/finding jobs with verified onboarding, real-time communication, AI-driven matching, escrow-based payments, gamification, and automatic digital portfolio building. Key Features: • Secure university email-based signup. • Single marketplace for services and products. • AI matching (skills, keywords, category). • Escrow payment simulation (UPI, demo-ready). • In-app chat, verified transaction reviews. • Automatic, verifiable portfolio update per task/job. • Gamification with badges, stars, certificates. • Modern dark UI, responsive and accessible. • Administrative dashboards for user analytics. System Architecture &amp; Design Diagrams Architecture Highlights • Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS (component-based, fast, mobile-ready). • Backend: Django REST API (Python, robust, secure, rapid API dev). • Database: MySQL (relational, integrity, scalable). • AI Service: Python (keyword matching for MVP, FAISS for future AI). • Authentication: JWT tokens, secure onboarding. • Payment Logic: Escrow (simulated for hackathon using UPI pipeline). User and Data Flow: 1. Onboard with verifiable university ID/email. 2. Users can list services/products or request jobs. 3. AI matching suggests most relevant matches. 4. Negotiation via in-app chat, secure payment. 5. Upon completion, portfolio and reviews auto-update. Block Diagram, Activity Diagram, and ERD are provided in the documentation (/docs/).
